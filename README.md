# 🔍 Search Engine Auto-Completion

A **Trie + Heap based Auto-Complete System** that suggests the most relevant search queries based on user input prefixes — just like Google or YouTube search boxes.

This project demonstrates efficient prefix-based searching using **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** concepts such as **Trie, DFS, and Max Heap**.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Suggests the **Top-K most frequent** search completions.
- ✅ Uses a **Trie** for prefix-based lookups.
- ✅ Uses a **Max Heap (priority queue)** for ranking results by frequency.
- ✅ Supports **multi-word queries** (e.g., "how to make pizza").
- ✅ Interactive console-based demo.
- ✅ Easily extendable for real datasets.

## 🧠 Data Structures Used

| DSA | Purpose |
|-----|----------|
| **Trie (Prefix Tree)** | Stores all search queries for fast prefix lookup |
| **DFS (Depth-First Search)** | Traverses all completions of a given prefix |
| **Heap / Priority Queue** | Returns top-k highest frequency suggestions efficiently |
